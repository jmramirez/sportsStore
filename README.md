# SportsStore

The idea of this project is to define a small e-commerce application, using ASP.NET Web API 2, in the backend, and diferent tools, such as
React, Knockout, and JQuery in the front end.

## CSS

For CSS I'll be using semantic-ui.

** To run the project, once you clon it, it's necessary to restore the Nuget packages, and after that run: Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r
